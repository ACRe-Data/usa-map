h1. Easy to use USA map

After needing to put a map up of the USA that people could click on the state and go to a URL just for that state and not finding anything remotly worth a crap, I put this together to make my life easier.

I hope it helps you as well

I can not think of an easier way to do this... if you can, let me know cuz you are smarter than I am ;)

This is GPL

I am not sure where the map came from but I have seen it everywhere and assume it is public domain ( If anyone finds out otherwise please let me know )

Enjoy,
